    <h2>Individual Sessions</h2>
    <p>These sessions allow clients to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop imagination using a range of art materials</li>
      <li>Explore the meaning of past and present experiences</li>
      <li>Gain and build confidence and inspiration</li>
      <li>Find creative ways of gaining insight and self-knowledge</li>
      <li>Experience the health and creative benefits of self-expression with the support of an experienced and trained therapist</li>
      <li>Enjoy using art materials and create a portfolio of your personal images and objects</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>Artistic skills are not a requirement to benefit from the sessions. Most of us make marks, scribbles, doodles and images during our lives. The sessions enable this and further mark-making to be accessible to those who wish to discover and work with their own ideas and emotions in a constructive way.</p>
    <h2>Group Workshops</h2>
    <p>Working with others in a group can provide further benefits including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support and encouragement from peers</li>
      <li>A sense of unity and common purpose</li>
      <li>Sharing ideas and experiences</li>
      <li>Creative stimulation</li>
      <li>A safe and supportive environment to explore issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Workshops will often be more structured and focused on addressing the needs of the group, helping individuals to find their own creative expression and to build confidence in relationships and with oneself.</p>
